1. I went to lot of websites as a reference for the javascripts. Tutorialspoint and W3schools has helped me a lot to clear my doubts.

2. I have also seen a lot of youtube tutorials of javascripts on how to dynamically add photos to html.

3. I have faced a lot of error at the starting point in my javascrit file due to one small spelling error. However i overcomed my most of the errors by the trick of inspecting element.

4. I also had an error in my for loop. I overcame it by putting a debugger on the file and checking the code step by step.

5. One thing i wanted to add as an additional feature was a video in my background. I tried it, i also had my video in background by it was all mess, so i thought to drop the idea and continue with the static wallpaper. I also wanted to add the Canadian flag in the backgroung with low opacity, but no font color matched on different images. So i kept a small flag on top of image, when you open the image.

6. I have learned some fantastic funtions during the making of gallery and while going through the tutorials of the javascripts.
